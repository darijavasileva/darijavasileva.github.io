<h1>The Art of Dreaming</h1>
<p>
Dreaming is an art because it takes creativity and courage. The hours you spend 
asleep only define a small portion of the human capacity to dream. In our waking
hours, we actively yet subconciously curate our futures and imagine our most fulfilled
selves. Others may doubt our dreams, life circumstances may change, and bad luck may ensue
at any moment, but it's always within human nature to have hope and action. Tools like 
bucket lists, vision boards, and journals help define these seemingly faraway ambitions and 
turn them into actionable items. After viewing my digitized bucket list, I hope you're 
encouraged to think highly of yourself and your future, whether that's simply through 
positive encouragement or making a bucket list of your own. 
</p>

<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Hello viewers of my website! My name is Darija (Dah-ree-yah), and I'm a big dreamer. 
At the time of making this website, I recently turned 20 years old, which in my opinion, is a milestone
birthday. My adolescence is finally over, and I'm not interested in the activities associated with one's 21st birthday. My entry into the 20s age range inspired a lot of contemplation about what I'll be up to for the foreseeable future. I turned my contemplative thoughts into a website because I'm a <a href="https://www.figma.com/resource-library/what-is-ux-design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="link">UX designer</a>-in-training, meaning that I love well-structured, easy-to-understand content that is packaged in a visually pleasant way. The finished website and code for this website also happpens to be a required assignment for my Info Tech class, but luckily I live by the Confucius quote that goes, "Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life."</p>

<h2>Website Overview</h2>
<p>Central to my website's content structure are the three pages shown in the main navigation, and the tables ordered below each
page header.</p>

<h2>Pages</h2>
<ul>
<li>Career
<ul>
<li class="nested-list-item">The <a href="career.html" class="link">Career Goals</a> page title is self-explanatory, but it’s important to note that it also
includes actions that serve as prerequisites for certain career advancements, 
like education, certifications, and financial milestones.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Personal
<ul>
<li class="nested-list-item">In my <a href="personal.html" class="link">Personal Goals</a> page, improvements to mental and physical health, wellbeing, interpersonal relationships, and core values define this category. </li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Leisure
<ul>
<li class="nested-list-item">The <a href="leisure.html" class="link">Leisure Goals</a> page is all about having fun! Travel, enrichment, and
relaxation are the core of this part of the bucket list. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Completion Tables</h2>
<p>An individual goal listed under the Career, Personal, or Leisure pages is then placed into one of three tables:
completed goals, in-progress goals, and goals not yet started. The tables are sequentially displayed in
the order shown below. I like seeing my completed goals first, so I can get a good idea of how far I've come,
and then scroll down to see how much life I have ahead of me.</p>

<ol>
<li>Completed Goals</li>
<li>In-Progress Goals</li>
<li>To-Do Goals</li>
</ol>
